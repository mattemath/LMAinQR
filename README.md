The abstract of the paper is the following:

_In the modelling of stochastic phenomena, such as quasi-reaction systems, parameter
estimation of kinetic rates can be challenging, particularly when the time gap between
consecutive measurements is large. Local linear approximation approaches account
for the stochasticity in the system but fail to capture the nonlinear nature of the
underlying process.
At the mean level, the dynamics of the system can be described by a system of ODEs,
which have an explicit solution only for simple unitary systems. An analytical solution
for generic quasi-reaction systems is proposed via a first order Taylor approximation of
the hazard rate. This allows a nonlinear forward prediction of the future dynamics given
the current state of the system. Predictions and corresponding observations are
embedded in a nonlinear least-squares approach for parameter estimation. The
performance of the algorithm is compared to existing SDE and ODE-based methods
via a simulation study.
Besides the increased computational efficiency of the approach, the results show an
improvement in the kinetic rate estimation, particularly for data observed at large time
intervals. Additionally, the availability of an explicit solution makes the method robust to
stiffness, which is often present in biological systems. An illustration on Rhesus
Macaque data shows the applicability of the approach to the study of cell
differentiation._
